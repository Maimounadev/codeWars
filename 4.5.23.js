//Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).

    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < arrayOfSheep.length; i++) {
      if (arrayOfSheep[i] === true) {
        count++;
